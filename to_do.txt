** TO DO **
°°°°°°°°°°°

- bubble: display Year, (single year if event in one year, two years if event spans over severals years...)
- SEARCH: allow search to give results, even if the event is allready running (multiple day events currently doesnt show up as result when search start date is after event_startdate), "include" logic?
- marker logic:
  - if there is no marker to show, then do nothing, don't pan to "nowhere"!
    - give nice messages!
- still to do: hashcode: rauswerfen was geht!
- new/edit contacts form : 
  - check for validity, no empty fields should be allowed!
  - check for propper date range, dont allow enddate to be before startdate



 


  MILESTONES

    - ADD authoriaztion
    - ADD admin panel to easyly manage events, etc. (oh, how to integrate the adresspicker in active admin?!?)






  WISHLIST

  - new/edit contact with full-page map and data entry on right hand "sidebar" (similar to frontpage)
  - nicer css for date/time picker
  - any chance to implememt a smarter fitMapToVisibleMarkers() ???
    so that no marker gets underneath any categories or the sidebar...
    Btw:is it desireable at all?

DONE, Finito. Grande!



- sidebar:  - some padding for the markers list UL
- ADD dates (datepicker ...) [] tables...
- isActive mit in Form einbauen
- refactor hash code
- add class "active" to clicked sidebar item (so it stays highlighted all time, even when indirect clicked through hash)
